# 🌀 Wave By Wave – 3D Action Game Prototype

**Wave By Wave** is my **first 3D action game prototype**, built to help me learn the core principles of 3D game development in Unity.  
In this arena-style game, the player must **dodge a large enemy and reach the flag to win**!

## 🎮 Project Overview

> **"This was my first 3D Action Game prototype and the player must reach the flag to win!"**

**Wave By Wave** was created as a personal learning experience in:

- 🎮 3D player movement  
- 📷 Basic third-person camera control  
- 🧱 Arena-style level layout  
- 💢 Health and damage systems  
- 🏁 Victory conditions and game loop logic

The game features a minimal yet functional level where survival and strategy are key.

## 🧠 What I Learned

*Wave By Wave* was my first hands-on experience with Unity’s 3D systems. It gave me insight into:

- 🎮 3D character movement and physics
- 📷 Designing and configuring third-person cameras
- 💢 Health and damage tracking using UI elements
- 🏟️ Constructing arena-style levels that encourage interaction
- 🧠 Balancing challenge through enemy AI and player feedback

> This prototype gave me confidence in developing 3D mechanics and laid the groundwork for more advanced action games.
